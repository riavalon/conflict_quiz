						<h1 class="caps mb1 bold">Compelling or Forcing</h1>

						<p>Compelling is the use of physical or emotional force, authority, or pressure to oblige or constrain one party to do something another party wants done.</p>

						<p>A person cannot be compelled to <em>think</em> a certain way, however, they can be compelled to <em>act</em> according to the wishes of those with the most authority, power, or physical force.)</p>

						<p>Compelling is like the use of certain drugs: In short-term emergencies they are sometimes called for, when nothing else will probably work. But in the long term, Compelling is caustic and rots out relationships and organizations.</p>
