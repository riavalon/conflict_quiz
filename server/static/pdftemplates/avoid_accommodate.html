						<h1 class="caps bold mb2">Avoiding, Ignoring, Accommodating, or Fleeing</h1>

						<h2 class="caps bold mb1">Avoiding</h2>

						<p>When one avoids conflict, one evades it or stays away from it. One attempts to skirt it or keep it from happening.</p>

						<hr />

						<h2 class="caps bold mb1">Ignoring</h2>

						<p>Ignoring a conflict is acting as if it weren't going on. Most poeple aren't able to do this very well.</p>

						<hr />

						<h2 class="caps bold mb1">Fleeing</h2>

						<p>Ignoring (above) is the only passive strategy for dealing with conflict. Avoidance takes effort and attention to what is happening; so does fleeing. Fleeing is actively removing yourself from teh arena in which the conflict might take place. As a conflict management strategy, feeling can occur before or durng a conflict. If it occurs after the conflict has taken place, it would be a result of conflict not a conflict management strategy.</p>

						<hr />

						<h2 class="caps bold mb1">Accommodating</h2>

						<p>When you accommodate, you go along with the other, with the opposition. A person using accomodative style often sees the relationship being more important that the issue. Often, suppressing the feelings that arise when you are not able to get what you want because you choosing to go along with what the other wants requires self-control.</p>

							When to use Avoiding, Ignoring, Accommodating, or Fleeing Strategies.
						</h2>

						<p>Sometimes the <em>cost</em> of working a problem through is greater than the <em>value</em> of having it worked through. In those cases, these strategies would be the right choice.</p>

						<p>When people within the organization or relationship are particularly fragile and insecure, you may choose not to "work" certain issues because doing so would cause too much damage.</p>

						<p>When people need time or "space" to cool down, avoidance is sometimes appropriate.</p>

						<p>When there is conflict on many fronts, you may want to avoid certain areas of conflict to devote your energy to others.</p>

						<p>When the differences are trivial or irrelevant to your relationship or the organization, they are often best avoided.</p>

						<p>When parties in a conflict are unable or unwilling to reconcile their differences or attempt to work them through and they ust continue to be in the same place or work together, Avoidance, Accommodating, and/or ignoring are the only choices available.</p>

						<p>When you don't care about the relationship and the quality of interaction within it, Avoidance, or Fleeing is appropriate.</p>

						<p>When you are powerless to affect change of any kind, when the other does not or will not respond, and repeated efforts have been made to invite the other to address the issues with you and try to work them through, then Fleeing (leaving) is the only choice.</p>
